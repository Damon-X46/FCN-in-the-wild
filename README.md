# FCNs in the Wild Pixel-level Adversarial and Constraint-based Adaptation

pytorch implemention of this [arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02649)

The FCN model used is papre [Multi-scale context aggregation by dilated convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07122)

## note 
In the [GTA5 dataset](https://download.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/data/from_games/), the label file is png format which uses palette, so to train the model should record the palette infomation to recover the output  with color
